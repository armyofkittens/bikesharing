# Bikesharing Analysis
## Overview
After visiting NYC and using their awesome bikesharing service, we had the idea to start the same service in Des Moines, Iowa. The purpose of this analysis is to find peak hours, volume by gender, volume by subscriber vs. customer, and best time to repair the bicycles, along with a multitude of other data points. This data will give our angel investor confidence to fund our company.

## Results
The results of the analysis have been linked to a [Tableau Public Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.knauff/viz/Bikesharing_Challenge_16559395862050/Story1?publish=yes)

## Summary
Multiple conclusions have been made based on this data. Firstly, subscribers make up most of the regular customers versus one-time users. Additionally, Thursdays tend to be the busiest day, and men predominately make up citibike customers. Peak hours are between 5-7pm, and the best time to repair the bicycles are between 2-5am. Marketing money should be put into promotions attracting more female riders, as well as days where ride volume is lower. 

### Suggested Additional Visualizations
1.) Include a breakdown of stations by Gender

2.) Peak hours by birth year.
