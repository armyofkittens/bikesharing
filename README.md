# Bikesharing Analysis
## Overview
After visiting NYC and using their awesome bikesharing service, we had the idea to start the same service in Des Moines, Iowa. The purpose of this analysis is to find peak hours, volume by gender, volume by subscriber vs. customer, and best time to repair the bicycles, along with a multitude of other data points. This data will give our angel investor confidence to fund our company.

## Results
The results of the analysis have been linked to a [Tableau Public Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.knauff/viz/Bikesharing_Challenge_16559395862050/Story1?publish=yes)
